            What is intimacy without humanity?
          </h3>
        
          
          <p>
          Dan is an interaction designer with several years of software and hardware prototyping and production experience. He communicates his ideas through working prototypes, design research insights, expoloring new ways of user interactions. Working in the realms of interaction design and product design, Dan explores the new ways of interaction and communication through working prototypes and storytelling, inviting a reflective evaluation and implication.

          <p>
            The desire to create relationships and environments that make us feel comfortable, provide a sense of security, and facilitate sensations of belonging is inherent to human nature. Human to human interaction is critical to mental and physical health, but how about human to machine interaction? Does replacing our most intimate human relationships with machine interactions rob our life of its meaning?
            Exploring interactions that use Robotic Intimacy Technology (RIT), this thesis raises
            questions regarding the quality of intimate sensations offered through technology â€” comfort versus discomfort, sincerity versus insincerity. 
          </p>

          <p>
          He has several degrees including a MAS from MIT, an MFA in digital media from RISD and a BFA in communication design from UConn. He has over 13 years of design experience. Previous positions include MIT Lifelong Kindergarten as an industrial designer and mechanical engineer and Johnson & Johnson as Senior Interaction Designer.
